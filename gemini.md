# Tabletop Craps

This project is a simple web-based implementation of a simplified version of game craps. It is used as a drinking game or any other time that people would like to play around the tabletop.

## Rules

1. The game is played by rolling 2 dice.
2. First roller is chosen at random.
3. When the first roller rolls a 7, he/she wins. It also means that everyone else loses.
4. If a number other than 7 is rolled, the game is continued with a next roll. The rolled number is now marked as a losing number, and the dice are passed to the next roller.
5. On any subsequent roll, if the next roller rolls the losing number again, he/she loses. If it is any other number, the dice is passed on to the next roller.


## Quick Start

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2.  Click the "Roll Dice" button to start the game.
